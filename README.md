 - Complete the provided exercise using a React based frame work and any other Libraries that may arise. 
 - Project Must be submitted no later than 6/17/2022 Friday . And forwarded to software@escapegameover.com
 - All assets , pre requisites have been provided under the assets folder

> Have in mind the following things:
- Pay equal attention, both to the code quality and to the look-and-feel of the deliverable. The result should be pixel-perfectly aligned with the provided design.
- You are more than welcome to add animations and micro-interactions wherever you think they fit. They will be highly appreciated.
Make sure that the deliverable behaves properly at all viewport sizes.
- If you don’t have time, prefer to deliver a smaller part of the project from delivering a subpar result. On the contrary, if you have extra time, consider adding some interactive functionality such as opening the top-left “user dropdown” or anything that you might think of.

Regarding the code provided:
- The project already includes the font, the svg icons and the images that you will need. Check src/assets/ directory.
- Adding types and/or interfaces to your components is not required but it will be highly appreciated.
- Feel free to change the file structure if you want, but it will be nice if you aligned your code to the provided structure.

You can deliver the code back either through a .zip or through a private repo (you will need to give us access though).

Don’t hesitate to reach out with an email at software@escapegameover.com any time for additional instructions or clarifications.

Happy coding! :-)
